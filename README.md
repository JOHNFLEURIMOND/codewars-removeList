## Lessons Learned
I learned how to use new Set and the spread operator! Which is going to be a game changer! It made solving this problem that much faster then I had before with a nested loop, indexOf, and push methods.

The Set object lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references.

So creating  return [...new Set(a)]; it allowed me to return no duplicates.
